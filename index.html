		<h1>Rebuilding the Original Pennsylvania Station in Paper</h1>	
		<p>Pennsylvania Station was TKTKTK. Torn down! Replaced by a horror. For my art I build models of spaces I love that suggest memory, time and childhood. In this current project I have been building a model of Penn Station out of paper models I build in Photoshop. then cut fold and glue with hot glue.  <a href="http://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=Detroit%20Publishing%20Co%20Pennsylvania%20Station%20New%20York&st=gallery">Here</a></p>
