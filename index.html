		<h1>Rebuilding the Original Pennsylvania Station in Paper</h1>	
		
		<p>For my art I like to build dreamy almost childlike models. Having grown up in New York City I build scenes from the city's past as well as my own. For my latest project I am building a paper model of the original Pennsylvania Station's grand concourse and train platform. I have been building the pieces in Photoshop, printing cutting and folding then by hand then gluing them together with hot glue. It is a work in progress!</p>	

		<p>Pennsylvania Station was a grand monument to train travel given to New York City by the Pennsylvania Station. Built in 1905 by McKim, Mead and White, its classical facade and massive steel frame train concourse were a symbol of past glories and hope for a greater future. It only lasted 53 years and was torn down in 1963. It reopened underground while the current iteration of Madison Square garden was built on top.</p>

	<p>My favorite news site is the New York Times. I am always inspired by how they design their photo stories. They are elegantly and cleaned designed. This is a recent example on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/09/magazine/big-food-photo-essay.html?ref=magazine&_r=0">industrial farming</a>.While the site might look complicated its bones are still simple well structured semantic html. I see divs, spans, header, h2, img, figure, figurecaption, p and br tags.
