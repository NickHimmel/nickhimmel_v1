		<h1>Rebuilding the Original Pennsylvania Station in Paper</h1>	
		
		<p>For my art I like to build dreamy almost childlike models. Having grown up in New York City I build scenes from the city's past as well as my own. For my latest project I am building a paper model of the original Pennsylvania Station's grand concourse and train platform. I have been building the pieces in Photoshop, printing cutting and folding then by hand then gluing them together with hot glue. It is a work in progress!</p>	

		<p>Pennsylvania Station was a grand monument to train travel given to New York City by the Pennsylvania Station. With its classical facade and a massive steel frame train concourse, it was a symbol of past glories and hope for a greater future. It only lasted 53 years and was torn down in 1963.</p>
