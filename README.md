# My Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio website. I am a web developer and artist living in New York City. I recently completed Dev Bootcamp, an intensive web development program in New York City, where I acquired advanced skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and React. Before that, I earned a master's degree in digital photography from SVA.
